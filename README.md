# dotfiles

My dotfiles for UNIX.
This repository is inspired by [github.com/haru067/dotfiles](https://github.com/haru067/dotfiles) :ramen: .


## Installation

```
curl -fsSL https://dot.usagiga.me/install.sh | sh
```

`install.sh` is located at `/docs` to host it on GitHub Pages.
So, actually, `/docs` is not only for docs.
